## About Proteus

starter kits to help you prototype faster. It follows the
[thoughtbot styleguide](https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides) and includes our

About Jekyll
---------------
Jekyll is a static site generator built in Ruby. This makes it a great fit
for projects that may end up as a Ruby on Rails app.

Includes
--------
* [HAML](http://haml.info):
  Simple template markup
* [Coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org):
  Write javascript with simpler syntax
* [Sass](http://sass-lang.com):
  CSS with superpowers
* [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io):
  Sass mixin library
* [Neat](http://neat.bourbon.io):
  Semantic grid for Sass and Bourbon
* [Bitters](http://bitters.bourbon.io):
  Scaffold styles, variables and structure for Bourbon projects.

We also recommend [Refills](http://refills.bourbon.io/) for prepackaged interface patterns

Getting Started
---------------
Set up your project in your code directory
```
git clone --bare git@github.com:thoughtbot/proteus-jekyll.git [your-project-name]
bundle install
```

Run the server and watch for changes in your files
```
jekyll serve -w
```

Deploy to Github Pages
```
jekyll build && git subtree push --prefix build origin gh-pages
```

Or clone the repo and use these handy shortcuts: `. bin/setup`, `. bin/server` and `. bin/deploy`

Stylesheets, fonts, images, and javascript files go in the `/source/_assets/` directory.
Vendor stylesheets and javascripts should go in each of their `/vendor/` directories.
